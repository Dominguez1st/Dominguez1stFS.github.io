			<h2>Passion Project</h2>
			<p><strong>Project Description: </strong>A passion project that I always considered doing after I have acquired
				the proper skills for it is creating a card game application. The logic of the game is would be quite
				challenging as it require many functions to work in conjunction with each other to move the cards in the
				right way across the "board". Like-wise the project will require me to get creative with the effects of the
				cards and how it would give the player a sense of fun and enjoyment.</p>
			<p><strong>Elevator Pitch: </strong>Hi, my name is Robert. I am currently studying at the Deep Dive Fullstack
				development Bootcamp in order to expand my skill set and acquire practical experience. I am doing this in
				hopes of one day doing my own passion project. Would you be interested in hearing more?</p>

			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<p>Currently ongoing. Some of the stuff we have on over is stuff I am already familiar from my Computer Science
			Degree but I can already tell that it's somewhat more work focused around the workforce rather than just for the
			sake of learning</p>
