			<h2>Passion Project</h2>
			<p><strong>Project Description: </strong>A passion project that I always considered doing after I have acquired
				the proper skills for it is creating a card game application. The logic of the game is would be quite
				challenging as it require many functions to work in conjunction with each other to move the cards in the
				right way across the "board". Like-wise the project will require me to get creative with the effects of the
				cards and how it would give the player a sense of fun and enjoyment.</p>
			<p><strong>Elevator Pitch: </strong>Hi, my name is Robert. I am currently studying at the Deep Dive Fullstack
				development Bootcamp in order to expand my skill set and acquire practical experience. I am doing this in
				hopes of one day doing my own passion project. Would you be interested in hearing more?</p>

			<h2>Visual Speaks</h2>
			<p>For my first image I choose a picture of the moon to show that even in the dark of night I still have some
			light. I think that this summarizes my current career quite well in that I am in the dark in regards to a lot
			of things but there is still some knowledge that I have. My second picture is of the sun. I choose this one to
			symbolize that in three years time I will not be in the dark and instead be in possession of skills and knowledge.</p>

			<p><strong>Reflections: </strong> This activity opened my eyes to just how common of a name that I have. While
				it is true that I very little of a online presence, my search results revealed that there are many others
			with my name. I discovered that the name Dominguez is 254th most common name in the United States. After much
			googling I found that I was unable to find any of my sites without directly going to them from previous knowledge.
			This means that when I begin to make my professional online presence I will have much work to do but that I will
			also be able to control what employers see better.</p>

			<h2>Salary Expectations and Potential</h2>
			<p>
				Due to my degree in computer science I think that it would be reasonable to start between $45k-$50k as a junior
				web developer. While I would naturally I would prefer a higher salary, I know that this early in my career the
				experience that I gain will greatly help me down the the long term so I would not be opposed at all to starting
				a little lower.

			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<h3>Week 1</h3>
			<p> Some of the stuff we have on over is stuff I am already familiar from my Computer Science
			Degree but I can already tell that it's somewhat more work focused around the workforce rather than just for the
			sake of learning. At the end of the week we went to a New Mexico Technology Council and got to meet with professionals and hear
			some advice from them which informative</p>
			<h3>Week 2</h3>
			<p> Near the beginning of the week was pretty ok with the javascript however as the week went on we began to
			begin Object-Oriented Programming which is pretty hard. I'm really grateful that my brother also knows Object-Oriented
			so I can ask him for help in understanding it. I'm currently still trying to get a good grasp on it
			but overall I still feel like I'm learning. At the end of this week we went to UNM to view an mobile application
			contest. It was really impressive seeing what the participants had created. </p>
			<h3>Week 3</h3>
			<p> This week we finished object-oriented for time being and began to work on our capstone projects and CSS. The
			CSS project seemed simple at first but upon working on it more I realized that it was harder than I anticipated,
			but in a fun way. We got divided up into our capstone groups and began working toward that. My group is working
			on an app that help users find and rate trails. It seems interesting and I look forward to seeing what we do with
			it.</p>
			<h3>Week 4</h3>
			<p> This week we started to learn bootstrap. I think that it's pretty useful but for the current moment I will
			continue to practice my CSS skills. The bootstrap challenge was alright and I think that I did pretty good on it.
			For prodev, I met up with my capstone team for lunch at a sandwich shop and we ate together talked about the
			future of our capstone project. We also played a board game called Forbidden Island, while we ended up losing
			it was still fun communicating with my team and try to work toward victory.</p>
			<h3>Week 5</h3>
			<p>Almost all of this week was spent doing unit testing. My team and I are slowly but surely making good progress
			as we go through unit testing. At the time of writing this my team and I are, at least we think, almost done with
			unit testing. I also got my PWP milestone 2a graded so that means that I can start working on that.</p>
